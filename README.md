# FilterBro
A loot filter updater and custom sound replacement tool for Path of Exile.

# What It Is
FilterBro can download and update loot filters from developers who have their filters posted online. New filters can be added in future software updates, with the plan eventually being the ability to update supported filters without having to redownload the application. For now, if there is a filter that gets posted/updated online that you want to see available for management in FilterBro, please contact me and I will see what I can do.

To download a filter, simply select one from the list and click Install.

To update a filter, select it and click Check for Update.

To reinstall a filter, select it and click Reinstall.

FilterBro also has the ability to replace default sounds in installed filters with custom sounds. Simply place your custom sounds in your Path of Exile directory in My Documents\My Games, select a filter, and click Custom Sounds. From there it should be straightforward what you need to do. Don't like the changes you made to a supported filter? Simply reinstall the filter that you modified and edit it again.

# What It Isn't
FilterBro is not a tool for creating custom filters. It also currently does not support previewing built-in filter sounds. FilterBro does not modify the Path of Exile game client in any way.

# Installation Instructions
Download the latest release, extract the zip file to a folder of your choosing, and launch FilterBro.exe. FilterBro does not have to be placed in your Path of Exile directory, but it does need to be in the same folder as the files that it comes with. It will create a folder inside of My Documents\My Games\Path of Exile for downloading filters.

# Donations
