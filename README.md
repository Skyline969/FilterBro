# FilterBro
A loot filter updater for Path of Exile.

# What It Is
FilterBro can download and update loot filters from developers who have their filters posted online. New filters can be added in future software updates.

To download a filter, simply select one from the list and click Install.

To update a filter, select it and click Check for Update.

To reinstall a filter, select it and click Reinstall.

FilterBro also has the ability to replace default sounds in installed filters with custom sounds. At the moment, FilterBro only supports the filters that it installs. Simply place your custom sounds in your Path of Exile directory in My Documents\My Games, select a filter, and click Custom Sounds. From there it should be straightforward what you need to do. Don't like the changes you made? Simply reinstall the filter that you modified and edit it again.

# What It Isn't
FilterBro is not a tool for creating custom filters. It is also currently not a tool for managing your own filters. Fortunately, this also means that your own filters will not be touched by FilterBro. Only filters that match the ones supported by FilterBro will be managed by it. FilterBro does not modify the Path of Exile game client in any way.

# Installation Instructions
Download the latest release, extract the zip file to a folder of your choosing, and launch FilterBro.exe. FilterBro does not have to be placed in your Path of Exile directory, but it does need to be in the same folder as the files that it comes with.
